# UFOs
## Overview

We have been tasked with assiting Dana with her current webpage that includes a dynamic table.   Dana would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by not only allowing users to filter by date but also other attributes such as city, state, country and shape.  


## Results
In Dana's original webpage an user was only capable of filtering data by the date.  Dana wanted to make the site more reactive by including additional filters such as city, state, country and shape.  As stated previously once the user goes to the website they are able to filter the data by not only date, but also by city, state, counttry and shape. The filters are already prefilled with the first row of data in the data set.  However, the user can type over and enter their individual search criteria.  The user is able to use one filter or all to really dive into specific criteria. Once the filter criteria has been entered the user only needs to hit the "Filter Table" toggle button and desired information is displayed.

## Summary
Although the webpage is in itself pretty awesome  There could be improvements.  The biggest drawback/subsequent recommendation that I see is that the information is pulled from a file and not scrapped from another webpage.  Therefore, the information is dated.  If a user was looking for information from 2021 there would be nothing there for them although I'm sure that there has been sightings this year.  Second recommendation would be to include additional information.  This could be in the form of an about page that goes into more detail on the purpose of the website.  Or a page that gives more information on whether these sightings were confirmed or not.  Finally, the page could be more interactive with links to other sites such as the US government, NASA etc.
